- make the page for the registration button as well? (I guess maybe we can use a google form?) 
- work with Dawn to make that registration page part of the fcp website? https://fcp.sutd.edu.sg/
- For the actual registration page, maybe you can check with Dawn what are the information required, I guess: name, salutation, organisation, designation, country, email, will be needed. Also, we may add otic@sutd.edu.sg as the contact email, in case people have any questions.
